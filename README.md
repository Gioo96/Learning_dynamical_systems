## Lab 1: Nonparametric system identification of a single-link manipulator
A nonparametreic bayesian viewpoint is used to estimate the inverse dynamic of a single-link manipulator.\

## Lab 2: System identification of a synthetic model using the PEM method
The PEM estimate is computed using some predetermined model structures.\

## Lab 3: Adaptive position control of a DC servomotor
The transfer function describing the relation between the input voltage applied to the actuator and the output of the encoder is recursively estimated (PEM recursive identification) by using the ARX model structure. Moreover, the compensator design is also addressed where the corresponding numerator and denominator polynominals are computed by solving the Diophantine equation.\

## Lab 4: Parametric system identification of a bike sharing process
A Fisherian viewpoint is adopted to extrapolate the relation between the windspeed and the count of rental bikes of a bike sharing process.\
